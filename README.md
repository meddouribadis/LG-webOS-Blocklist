# LG webOS Blocklist

This is a DNS blocklist that attempts to block ads, tracking and
recommendations on LG webOS TVs. The blocklist attempts to avoid as much
breakage as possible, meaning it ONLY blocks stuff that doesn't break normal
functionality and features of webOS.

The list is written in ABP syntax, so it's compatible with newer Pi-hole versions.

To use it, add
[this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsapti/LG-webOS-Blocklist/main/list.txt)
to your ABP-compatible ad-blocker, or copy it below:
